> I worked with a small team of three to create a traveling app using Adobe XD and Figma as a side project. We created multiple wireframes and designs on notebooks and software. We also brainstormed and used many references to achieve a great UI and UX that is up to today’s standards while being unique and different from other applications. Once the wireframes were complete, we worked closely with an offshore development team.

> As a Web Producer at KPMG, I assisted with migrating their US Portal from a legacy version of SharePoint into SharePoint 2016 with a team of six other web producers and developers. We moved over thousands of classified documents during the migration. Once the migration was complete, I got promoted to a web development position. I helped the design team create and manage new SharePoint sites for different departments at KPMG. We used UI/UX software like Adobe XD, Adobe InDesign, and InVision and Helped design search functionality for their Portal.

> I created this website for my father's small commercial cleaning business. I used Adobe Dreamweaver at the time but then updated it using Brackets, then used a CMS to create the current one we see today. Once I finished building the website, I also helped bring traffic to the site using SEO and advertisements. I made their social media accounts and managed them to help bring more traffic to the website.
